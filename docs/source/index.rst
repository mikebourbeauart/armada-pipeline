Armada Pipeline
***************

.. important::

    Development Status:

        Armada Launcher: `Beta`

        Marina Docker: `Beta`

        Atlantis Asset Management: `In Development`

**Armada** is the main pipeline tool from which all project files (Maya, Houdini, etc) are
launched from.

Any files launched from Armada will be hooked into the pipeline, allowing the user
access to a library of scripts, plugins, automated file versioning workflows, and asset
management tools.
